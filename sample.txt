Input: sample.txt with content "hello world hello hadoop"
Command: hadoop jar wordcount.jar WordCount /input/sample.txt /output
Output:
hadoop  1
hello   2
world   1
Explanation: This output is derived theoretically based on the MapReduce logic in WordCount.java. The Mapper splits the input into words, emitting each with a count of 1, and the Reducer aggregates the counts for each word.
